# Mimica

### The backstory
Mimica was inspired by a classmate at Flatiron School, @Jesus-Escalona. One day after class, he told us about a super fun game that we should all try playing, called Mimica. None of us had ever heard of it before so we started searching online, but couldn't find any information about a game with that name. He then described how to play the game, which sounded a lot like the classic party game Charades. But Jesus insisted that it was not Charades, so we played anyway. It turned out to be almost identical to Charades, but it was so fun that we kept his name and his rules, and decided to create a Vanilla JS web-app version of it!

### How to play
- Users can start a game, add team names, player names, and choose words to act out in the style of Charades
- The user who is acting will get a random word from the category they choose when they click on the category
- Users will see the timer countdown to signify how long they have to guess the word
- Users will then be able to choose a new word/pick new actor once complete

### Work in Progress: Next Steps
- Refactor front end into React
- Update the backend API to store player names, team names, and scores - add CRUD functionality for team/player names. 
- Add more words to the seed file and/or find a way to generate those from an external API. 
- Optimize the layout
